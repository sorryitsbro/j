public static void main(String args[])
{
int sumeven=0, sumodd=0;
for(int i=1;i<=100;i++)
{
if(i%2==0)
{
sumeven = sumeven+i;
}
else
{
sumodd = sumodd+i;
}
}
System.out.println("The sum of even positions is "+ sumeven);
System.out.println("The sum of odd positions is "+ sumodd);

7. Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a method to
calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are (Task02 –
L1)
i -having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
ii - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth
respectively.
iii - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their
areas.
Solution

import java.util.*;
class Rectangle
{
int length;
int breadth;
void area() // method
{
int area=length*breadth;
System.out.println(area);
}
Rectangle() // constructor with no parameter
{
length=0;
breadth=0;
}
Rectangle(int len)// constructor with one parameter{
length=len;
breadth=len;
}
Rectangle(int l,int b) // constructor with two parameters
{
length=l;
breadth=b;
}
Rectangle(Rectangle r) //copy constructor
{
length=r.length;
breadth=r.breadth;
}
public static void main(String args[])
{
int len, br;
Rectangle r1= new Rectangle();
System.out.print("Area of object r1 : ");
r1.area();
Scanner input= new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter the length and breadth");
len=input.nextInt();
br=input.nextInt();
Rectangle r2= new Rectangle(len, br);
System.out.print("Area of object r2 : ");
r2.area();
Rectangle r3= new Rectangle(50);
System.out.print("Area of object r3 : ");
r3.area();
Rectangle r4= new Rectangle(r2);
System.out.print("Area of object r4 : ");
r4.area();}}


Output:
Area of object r1 : 0
Enter the length and breadth
2 3
Area of object r2 : 6
Area of object r3 : 2500
Area of object r4 : 68. 


8. AVR apartments uses a common water tank to supply water for every block. The D block
uses 20 litres of water and E block uses 40 litres of water every time. Each time the water level
of the tank reduces based on the usage of each block The maintenance person fills the tank thrice
with 50litres each time. Display the current water level in the tank.
