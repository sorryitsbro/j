Programs for Module 2
1. XYZ shopping mall wants to distribute lucky coupon for its customers. Each lucky coupon has some
prize amount. The mall executive wants to pick 100 order numbers randomly. The order number lies
between 1000 and 9999. Design a java application which helps the executive to determine the winners
of lucky coupon. The customer is winner if order number is palindrome and if it belongs to those 100
randomly picked one.
Program


import java.util.Random;
public class Array {
public static void main(String args[]) {
int min = 1000;
int max = 9999;
int ordernum[] = new int[100];
Random r = new Random();
for(int i =0; i<100;i++)
{
ordernum[i] = r.nextInt((max - min) + 1) + min;
}
for(int i=0; i < ordernum.length; i++)
{
int number = ordernum[i];
int reversedNumber = 0;
int temp=0;
while(number > 0)
{
temp = number % 10;
number = number / 10;
reversedNumber = reversedNumber * 10 + temp;
}
if(ordernum[i] == reversedNumber)
System.out.println("The customer with order number"+" "+ordernum[i]+" "+ "won the lucky
coupon");
}
}
}
Output
The customer with order number 4224 won the lucky coupon
The customer with order number 8888 won the lucky coupon

for(int j=0;j<3;j++)
{
itemlist[i][j]= s.nextInt();
}
}
for(int i=0;i<2;i++)
{
for(int j=0;j<3;j++)
{
totalcost[i]=totalcost[i]+ itemlist[i][j]*cost[j];
}
}
System.out.println("The total bill for Team A and Team B is as follows");
System.out.println("For Team A " + totalcost[0]);

5. XYZ bank wants to generate a 16 digit transaction password for the customers during each
transaction. The transaction password is constructed based on the username and some random digits.
Design a java application which generates a 16 digit transaction password using following rule
Note : Transaction Password = first half of user name + random digits + second half of user name
and total length of Transaction Password is 16. The entered username should not contain any blank
spaces.
Program:



import java.util.*;
public class Stringprogram1 {
public static void main(String args[]) {
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
Random r = new Random();
StringBuffer tpassword = new StringBuffer();
int min=0;
int max=9;
String name,firsthalf,secondhalf;
System.out.println("Enter username : ");
name = s.next();
int len = name.length();
System.out.println("Length of username is " + len);
firsthalf = name.substring(0,len/2);
secondhalf = name.substring(len/2,len);
tpassword.append(firsthalf);
for(int i = 0;i< 16-len; i++)
{
int num = r.nextInt((max - min) + 1) + min;
tpassword.append(num);
}
tpassword.append(secondhalf);
System.out.println("16 digits transaction password is : " + tpassword);
